Rainbow Cake!

* Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups of white granulated sugar
1 cup butter (softened)
3 eggs
1 tbsp of vanilla extract
1 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
3 cups of all purpose flour
1 tbsp of baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
Food coloring: red, yellow, blue, green, violet.

* Frosting:
12 oz cream cheese (softened)
1 1/2 cups butter (softened, do not melt)
6 cups of powdered sugar
1 tbsp of vanilla extract

Instructions:
* Preheat oven to 325 F.
* Generously grease and flour 6 (9-inch) cake pans.
* In a large bowl, cream together sugar and butter.
* Mix in eggs until thoroughly incorporated.
* Mix in vanilla extract, buttermilk and heavy cream.
* Mix in half of the flour, baking powder and salt.
* When mixture is combined, mix in the rest of the flour.
* Divide the batter into 6 bowls (about one cup of batter per bowl)
* Add food coloring in each bowl to create a vibrant red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet.
* Pour each colored batter into the prepared pans and spread out into an even layer.(layers will be thin)
* Bake for 10 to 15 minutes until center is set. Do not overbake. Keep a close eye on them as some ovens run hotter and these are thin layers.
* Remove from oven and let cakes cool in the pan until pans are warm enough to touch.
* Run a spatula around the edges of the pans to loosen the cake and then very carefully remove the cakes from the pans.
* Place on a cooling rack and cool completely.
* Meanwhile make the cream cheese frosting by creaming together cream cheese and butter.
* Mix in powdered sugar and vanilla.
* Place down the violet layer first and frost. Followed by the blue layer, green layer, yellow layer, orange layer and finally the red layer. (frost between each layer)
* Place a thin coat of the icing on the cake to create a crumb coat. This will make the cake even all around and seal any loose crumbs.
* Slice & Serve!
ProTip: *To create more defined layers of frosting between the colors, place the frosted cake in the fridge to allow the cream cheese frosting to firm up before slicing*
